Engineering  economy  is  the  discipline  concerned  with  the  economic 
aspect  of  engineering.  It  involves  the  systematic  evaluation  with  the  economic 
merits  of  proposed  solutions  to  the  engineering  problems.  To  be  economically 
acceptable (i.e., affordable), solutions to engineering problem must demonstrate 
a positive balance of long term benefits over long term cost. 
 
  Engineering economics is the application of economic techniques to the 
evaluation  of  design  and  engineering  alternatives.  The  role  of  engineering 
economics is to assess the appropriateness of a given project, estimate its value, 
and justify it from an engineering standpoint.
